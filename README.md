# Smash Ultimate Ladder (*Name Pending*)

This is an app to find competitive Smash Brothers Ultimate matches.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

As avid Smash Bro's players know, the online matchmaking can be very hit or miss, as there is no built-in competitive ruleset and the game will randomly pair you against players with non-competitive rulesets, leading to frustration.

With Ultimate Ladder, players will be able to find games with like-minded competitive players without any fluff.

## Open-Source

If you're a developer who is passionate about competitive smash, any contribution is both welcome and extremely appreciated! To get started, it'd be best to familiarize yourself with the T3 stack.
